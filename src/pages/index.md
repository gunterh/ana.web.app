  description: >
    With a flexible and convenient way to access my counselling services,
    clients can engage in “real time” whilst maintaining the same level of
    privacy and confidentiality they would come to expect during any face to

    you to communicate online in real time via video and/or voice connection.

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
